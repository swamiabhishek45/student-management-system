- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swamiabhishek45/student-management-system.git
cd student-management-system
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/student-management
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 4. Run the development servers

```bash

## MongoDB Schema Design

### Student

```
students collection
├── studentId    String   required, unique   (auto-generated: "STU" + Date.now())
├── name         String   required
├── email        String   required, unique
├── phone        String   required
├── address      String   required
├── grade        String   required
├── createdAt    Date     auto (timestamps)
└── updatedAt    Date     auto (timestamps)
```

### Teacher

```
teachers collection
├── name         String   required
├── email        String   required, unique
└── subject      String   required
```

### Course

```
courses collection
├── name         String           required
├── code         String           required, unique
├── credits      Number           required
├── teacherId    ObjectId → Teacher   required (ref)
├── createdAt    Date             auto (timestamps)
└── updatedAt    Date             auto (timestamps)
```

### Enrollment

```
enrollments collection
├── studentId    ObjectId → Student   required (ref)
├── courseId     ObjectId → Course    required (ref)
├── enrollDate   Date                 default: Date.now
├── createdAt    Date                 auto (timestamps)
└── updatedAt    Date                 auto (timestamps)

Compound unique index: { studentId: 1, courseId: 1 }
```

**Relationships**

```
Student ──< Enrollment >── Course
                              │
                           Teacher
```

- One student can enroll in many courses
- One course can have many enrolled students
- Each course is assigned to one teacher
- Deleting a student cascades and removes their enrollments
